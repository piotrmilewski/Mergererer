# Mergererer
## Jason Lam, Judy Liu, Piotr Milewski
We found runtimes of mergesort by subtracting the start time (time before mergesort is used) from the end time (time after mergesort is used). Then we plot them into a graph and compare it to O(n), O(n^2), O(log(n)), and O(nlog(n)) to see which graph looks the most similar.
